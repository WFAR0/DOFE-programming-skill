# DOFE programming skill

the DOFE programming course
    
05: guess my number, 06: modal and 07: pig game are all MY projects. the other files learning and using js in practice; there are also a few coding challenges which are like mini projects.

from 0 - 9 MY code is in final, from 10 - 18 MY code will be in starter. some github error innit.

i am sure all you'll need to look at is the finished projects and verify them, the js is all mine. i have done virtually none of the other code.
